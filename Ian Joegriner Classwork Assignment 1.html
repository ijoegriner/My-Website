        <p>LA is one of my favorite cites/areas to visit. One of the reasons its fun to visit is it has many events that happen exclusively in LA.</p>
        <p>From specialized concerts to conventions, LA always has something going on. Next thing are the beaches.</p>
        <p>LA beaches are so lively and active. I enjoy beaches that have a good social vibe, and all of the beaches in LA have that vibe.</p>
        <p>Finally the food. LA has a lot of really good authentic Mexican and Japanese food in the country. Everything there is worth a try!</p>
